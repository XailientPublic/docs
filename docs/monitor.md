With the Console, your can monitor your deployed AI models. You can view the models you have deployed, the device you have installed the models in and the frame counts you have used.

Go to __DASHBOARD__ form the navigation menu on the left.

Once you install a model on a device successfully, it will be listed on this page.

When you start using the SDK, you can see the frames you have used for each model on all devices here as well.
